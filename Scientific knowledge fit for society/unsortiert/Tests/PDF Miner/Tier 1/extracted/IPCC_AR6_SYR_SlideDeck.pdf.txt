The

hope

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate 
action now will reduce losses and damages
for nature and people.

The hope

Climate action provides co-beneﬁts.

Multiple, feasible and effective options are 
available to reduce GHG emissions
and adapt to human-caused climate change.

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

The 
challenge

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

• Cut emissions quickly, sharply to create a 

safer, sustainable world 

• Scale up practices and infrastructure to  

enhance resilience 

• Cut global GHG emissions by nearly half 

by 2030 

• Action required along numerous 

dimensions

The path forward is clear

Tried and tested 
options available now

Need to be designed 
for diverse contexts

Need to be scaled up 
and applied widely

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

Fairness is 
one of the 
solutions

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

• Those who contributed the least to climate 
change are often the most vulnerable to its 
impacts. 

• Millions exposed to acute food insecurity, 

reduced water security. 

• Biggest impacts in parts of Africa, Asia,  

Central/South America, LDCs, Small Islands, 
Arctic. 

• People in highly vulnerable areas up to 15x 

more likely to die in ﬂoods, droughts, storms 
(compared to those in in most resilient areas)

Increased 
financing for 
climate action

• 3-6 times the current climate investment 

• But there is enough global ﬁnancing to 

rapidly reduce emissions  

• Developing countries require external 
funding to meet adaptation needs 

• Options are available to scale up ﬁnancing

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

The way forward:
Climate-resilient 
development

Integrating measures to adapt to climate change 
with actions to reduce emissions in ways that 
provide wider beneﬁts:  

• Improving peoples’ health and livelihoods 

• Reducing poverty and hunger 

• Clean energy, water and air

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

Enablers for effective 
climate action

Political 
commitment

Inclusive 
governance

International 
cooperation

Effective 
ecosystem 
stewardship

Sharing of 
diverse 
knowledge

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

Human 
factors also 
enable action

Trust

Sharing of 
beneﬁts and 
burdens

Collaboration

Recognition

that some can contribute 
more than others

Sixth Assessment Report | Synthesis Report

Our choices will 
reverberate for
hundreds,  
even thousands,  
of years.
