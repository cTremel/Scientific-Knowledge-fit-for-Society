You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:If warming exceeds a specified level such as 1.5°C, it could gradually be reduced again by achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions. Overshoot entails adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems, all growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:1. 1.5°C, IS_ABOVE, CO2.2. CO2, HAS_IRREVERSIBLE_EFFECTS, HUMAN_SYSTEM.3. HUMAN_SYSTEM, HAS_ADDITIONAL_RISKS, NATURAL_SYSTEM.4. NATURAL_SYSTEM, HAS_IRREVERSIBLE_EFFECTS, CO2.

Note: The named entities and relations are based on the provided testimony and may vary depending on the specific context and task.
