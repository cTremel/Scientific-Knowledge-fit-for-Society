You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high confidence). 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 [Human, is, causing]                 [Climate, is, affecting]                 [Nature, and, people]                 [Vulnerable, are, disproportionately]                 [Historically, contributed]                 [Least, to]                 [Current, climate]                 [Affected]                 [Losses, and, damages]                 [Disproportionately]                 [Communities]                 [Who]                 [Are]                 [Disproportionately]                 [Affected]                 [Losses, and, damages]                 [Disproportionately]                 [Communities]                 [Who]                 [Are]                 [Disproportionately]                 [Affected]                 [Losses, and, damages]
