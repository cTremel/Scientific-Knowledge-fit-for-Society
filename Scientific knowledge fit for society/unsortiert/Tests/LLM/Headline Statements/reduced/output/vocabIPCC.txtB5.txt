You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions. Cumulative carbon emissions until the time of reaching net-zero CO2 emissions and the level of greenhouse gas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C (high confidence). Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%) (high confidence). 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 [CO2 emissions, EQUALS, greenhouse gas emission reductions]                 [existing fossil fuel infrastructure, HAS, remaining carbon budget]                 [1.5°C, EQUALS, 50%]                 [2°C, EQUALS, 50%]
