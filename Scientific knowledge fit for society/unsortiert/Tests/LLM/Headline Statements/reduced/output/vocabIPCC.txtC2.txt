You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade would reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems (very high confidence), and deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality and health (high confidence). Delayed mitigation and adaptation action would lock-in high-emissions infrastructure, raise risks of stranded assets and cost-escalation, reduce feasibility, and increase losses and damages (high confidence). Near-term actions involve high up-front investments and potentially disruptive changes that can be lessened by a range of enabling policies (high confidence). 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 [Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation, mitigation and adaptation action, adaptation actions]                 [projected losses and damages, reduce, humans and ecosystems]                 [delayed mitigation and adaptation, raise, risks of stranded assets and cost-escalation]                 [near-term actions, high up-front investments, potentially disruptive changes]                 [enabling policies, lessen]
