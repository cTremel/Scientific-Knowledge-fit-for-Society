[Burning fossil fuels, is influencing, the climate and the earth’s temperature]
[cutting down forests, is influencing, the climate and the earth’s temperature]
[farming livestock, is influencing, the climate and the earth’s temperature]
[this, adds, enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere]
[adding enormous amounts of greenhouse gases, increases, the greenhouse effect and global warming]
[Human-induced global warming, is increasing at a rate of, 0.2°C per decade]
[An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times, is associated with, serious negative impacts on the natural environment and human health and wellbeing]
[An increase of 2°C, is associated with, a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur]
[The main driver of climate change, is, the greenhouse effect]
[Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere, act, like the glass in a greenhouse]
[greenhouse gases, trap, the sun's heat and stop it from leaking back into space]
[human activities, are increasing, the concentrations of some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere]
[carbon dioxide (CO2), is, the largest contributor to global warming]
[Methane, is, a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2]
[Methane, has, a shorter atmospheric lifetime than CO2]
[Nitrous oxide, is, a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere over decades to centuries]
[Non-greenhouse gas pollutants, have, different warming and cooling effects]
[Non-greenhouse gas pollutants, are, associated with other issues such as poor air quality]
[Burning coal, oil and gas, produces, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide]
[Trees, help to regulate, the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere]
[Fertilisers containing nitrogen, produce, nitrous oxide emissions]
[Such emissions, have, a very strong warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO2]
[every tonne of CO2 emitted, contributes to, global warming]
[emissions reductions, contribute to, slowing global warming down]
[CO2 emissions, have to reach, net zero worldwide]
[reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases, can have, a powerful effect on slowing global warming – especially in the short term]
[The consequences of climate change, are, extremely serious]
[countering climate change, is, a top priority for the EU]
[adapting to a warming world, is, a top priority for the EU]
[climate action, is needed, now]
