While biofuels release CO2 when burned, some consider them a sustainable option because they are renewable and biomass removes some CO2 from the atmosphere as it grows.

The airline industry is currently responsible for about 3.5% of greenhouse gas emissions, roughly the same as the entire country of Japan, which is one of the world's highest emitters.

"What they're doing is quite important, they're just demonstrating that the flight is perfectly safe, there are no problems with the fuel," says David Lee, a professor of atmospheric science at Manchester Metropolitan University, who studies the impact of aviation on the climate, and who was a co-author of the paper that investigated the feasibility of transitioning to SAF.We will need an additional 70-80 million hectares of cropland bvy 2030 globally â€“ bigger than the state of Texas
Plus, what if you think you're buying up waste fats when you're not?

"There's substantial risk that that 'waste cooking oil' could be fraudulently relabelled virgin palm oil," says Daly."Biofuels providing the significant greenhouse gas savings needed to decarbonise jet fuel will not be available at scale," she says.
