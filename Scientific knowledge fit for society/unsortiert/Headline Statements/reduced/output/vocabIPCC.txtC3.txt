You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. These system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. Feasible, effective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available, with differences across systems and regions. 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 [Rapid, transition, systems]                 [transitions, across, all]                 [reductions, emissions, sustainable]                 [liveable, future, all]                 [mitigation, options, available]                 [adaptation, options, available]                 [differences, systems, regions]                 [effective, low-cost, options]                 [available, systems, regions]                 [systems, transitions, emissions]                 [reductions, emissions, sustainable]                 [emissions, reductions, sustainable]                 [systems, transitions, sustainable]                 [sustainable, future, all]                 [future, all, liveable]                 [liveable, future
