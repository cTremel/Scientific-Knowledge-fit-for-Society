You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Prioritising equity, climate justice, social justice, inclusion and just transition processes can enable adaptation and ambitious mitigation actions and climate resilient development. Adaptation outcomes are enhanced by increased support to regions and people with the highest vulnerability to climatic hazards. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs improves resilience. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive consumption, including through behavioural and lifestyle changes, with co-benefits for societal well-being. 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:  [vulnerability, RELATED_TO, regions],                   [social protection, IMPROVES_RESILIENCE, consumption].
