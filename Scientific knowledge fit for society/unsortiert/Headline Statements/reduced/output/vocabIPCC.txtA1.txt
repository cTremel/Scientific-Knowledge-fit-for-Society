You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are: 
[Human, caused, global warming] 
[Global greenhouse gas emissions, continued, increase] 
[Unsustainable, energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production] 
[Between, within, countries, among individuals] 

Please provide the next testimony.
