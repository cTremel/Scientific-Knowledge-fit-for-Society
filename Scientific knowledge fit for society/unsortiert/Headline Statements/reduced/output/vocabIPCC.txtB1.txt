You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5Â°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high confidence). Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also to discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years (high confidence). 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 [greenhouse gas emissions, lead, global warming]                 [global warming, will, increase]                 [increase, will, intensify]                 [hazards, high confidence]                 [reductions, lead, slowdown]                 [slowdown, will, changes]                 [changes, atmospheric composition, few years]
