You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, and those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), involve rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached for these pathway categories, in the early 2050s and around the early 2070s, respectively. 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:1. [Paris Agreement, has, global net zero CO2 emissions].2. [Paris Agreement, has, rapid and deep greenhouse gas emissions reductions].3. [Paris Agreement, has, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions].4. [emissions reductions, has, global net zero CO2 emissions].5. [emissions reductions, has, rapid and deep greenhouse gas emissions reductions].6. [emissions reductions, has, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions].
