 Everyone's talking about climate change, but what is our climate and why is it changing? Our climate is the earth's normal weather over a very long time. It usually takes hundreds or thousands of years for the climate to change, but recently our climate has been changing much faster. All these changes make life harder for our plants, animals, and for people around the world. And the biggest cause of climate change is humans, including you and me. When we use fuel like oil and gasoline, we'll move forests to make room. For cities or farms, we'll really screen house gases into our atmosphere. These screen house gases cause our climate to get warmer. Normally, when the heat from the sun warms our planet, some of the heat reflects back into space, but greenhouse gases act like a big blanket, holding some of it in. This extra heat can cause all sorts of problems for our planet. And the plants, animals, and people who live here. Our ice and snow are melting faster. Our oceans are getting warmer and higher, and our weather is becoming more extreme, with more heat waves, heavy rainfalls, and powerful hurricanes. Luckily, many countries around the world are working together to fight climate change, and there are lots of easy ways you and I can help too, like we're using things instead of throwing them out. Instead of driving, ride your bike, protect the bus. Use less electricity, and eat food growing closer to home. You and I, we can make a difference. We can fight climate change.
