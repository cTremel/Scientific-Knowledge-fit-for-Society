Given these entities: human activities, emissions, greenhouse gas, CO2, climate change, global warming, weather, adaptation, implementation, action, mitigation, policies, laws, climate goals, risks, impacts, losses, damages identify relationships and other named entities from this given content: Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). Not all given entities may appear in the content.     Format your output as triples [named entity A, relation, named entity B]
