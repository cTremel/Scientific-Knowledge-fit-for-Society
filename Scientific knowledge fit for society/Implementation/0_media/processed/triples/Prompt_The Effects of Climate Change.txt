You will perform the open information extraction task. You will identify the named entities in the content and then extract the relations between them. Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples, which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B]. Entities should not be more than 2 words. START of the testimony:This SectionClimate ChangeFactsVital SignsMitigation and AdaptationStoriesMoreEyes on the EarthThe Effects of Climate ChangeThe effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.En españolTakeawaysWe already see effects scientists predicted, such as the loss of sea ice, melting glaciers and ice sheets, sea level rise, and more intense heat waves.Scientists predict global temperature increases from human-made greenhouse gases will continue.Severe weather damage will also increase and intensify.Earth Will Continue to Warm and the Effects Will Be ProfoundThe potential future effects of global climate change include more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought in some regions, and an increase in the wind intensity and rainfall from tropical cyclones.left -
