You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all sectors and regions, with documented benefits and varying effectiveness. Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. Hard and soft limits to adaptation have been reached in some ecosystems and regions. Maladaptation is happening in some sectors and regions. Current global financial flows for adaptation are insufficient for, and constrain implementation of, adaptation options, especially in developing countries (high confidence).
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 Adaptation planning and implementation, progressed, all sectors and regions, documented benefits, varying effectiveness.                 Adaptation gaps, exist, will continue to grow, current rates of implementation.                 Ecosystems, reached hard and soft limits, some regions.                 Maladaptation, happening, some sectors and regions.                 Financial flows, insufficient, constrain implementation, developing countries, high confidence.
Please provide the actual testimony and I will help you with the task.
