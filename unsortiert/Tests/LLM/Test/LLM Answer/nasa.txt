[Global climate change, is not, a future problem]
[changes, are driven by, increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases]
[changes, are having, widespread effects on the environment]
[glaciers and ice sheets, are shrinking]
[river and lake ice, is breaking up, earlier]
[plant and animal geographic ranges, are shifting]
[plants and trees, are blooming, sooner]
[Effects, scientists had long predicted, would result from global climate change]
[sea ice loss, is, occurring]
[accelerated sea level rise, is, occurring]
[longer, more intense heat waves, are occurring]
[magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks, depend strongly on, near-term mitigation and adaptation actions]
[adverse impacts and related losses and damages, escalate with, every increment of global warming]
[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is, the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change]
[modern humans, have never before seen, the observed changes in our global climate]
[some of these changes, are irreversible over, the next hundreds to thousands of years]
[Scientists, have high confidence that, global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades]
[human emissions of heat-trapping gases, have already warmed, the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900]
[global average temperature, is expected to reach or exceed, 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades]
[severity of effects caused by climate change, will depend on, the path of future human activities]
[more greenhouse gas emissions, will lead to, more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet]
[we, can reduce, emissions]
[we, may avoid, some of the worst effects]
[scientific evidence, is, unequivocal]
[climate change, is, a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet]
[further delay in concerted global action, will miss, the brief, rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future]
