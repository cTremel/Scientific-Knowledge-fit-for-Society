Causes of climate change
Burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth’s temperature.

This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.

Human-induced global warming is presently increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade.

An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is associated with serious negative impacts on to the natural environment and human health and wellbeing, including a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur.

Greenhouse gases
The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect.Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming.

Many of these greenhouse gases occur naturally, but human activities are increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:

carbon dioxide (CO2)
methane
nitrous oxide
fluorinated gases
CO2 produced by human activities is the largest contributor to global warming.Other greenhouse gases are emitted by human activities in smaller quantities.Methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, but has a shorter atmospheric lifetime.Nitrous oxide, like CO2, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere over decades to centuries.Non-greenhouse gas pollutants, including aerosols like soot, have different warming and cooling effects and are also associated with other issues such as poor air quality.

Causes for rising emissions
Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.
Trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere.Fertilisers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions.
Such emissions have a very strong warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO2.
Countering climate change
As every tonne of CO2 emitted contributes to global warming, all emissions reductions contribute to slowing it down.In order to stop global warming completely, CO2 emissions have to reach net zero worldwide.In addition, reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can also have a powerful effect on slowing global warming – especially in the short term.

The consequences of climate change are extremely serious, and affect many aspects of our lives.Both countering climate change and adapting to a warming world are top priorities for the EU.We need climate action now.
