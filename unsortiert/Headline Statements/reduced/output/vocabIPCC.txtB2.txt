You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:For any given future warming level, many climate-related risks are higher than assessed in AR5, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher than currently observed (high confidence). Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). Climatic and non-climatic risks will increasingly interact, creating compound and cascading risks that are more complex and difficult to manage (high confidence). 
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:1. [Climate-related risks, are, higher]2. [Risks, and, projected, adverse, impacts]3. [Losses, and, damages, from, climate, change]
