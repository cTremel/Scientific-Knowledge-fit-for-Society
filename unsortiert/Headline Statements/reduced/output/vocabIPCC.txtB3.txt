You will perform the open information extraction task.                 You will identify the named entities in the content and                 then extract the relations between them.                 Based on the provided testimony, you will return triples,                 which are formatted as [named entity A, relation, named entity B].                 START of the testimony:Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible but can be limited by deep, rapid and sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The likelihood of abrupt and/or irreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels. Similarly, the probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increases with higher global warming levels.  
END of the testimony. The extracted triples formatted as                 [named entity A, relation, named entity B] are:                 [climate change, IS_CAUSING, global warming]                 [climate change, IS_IRREVERSIBLE, global warming]                 [climate change, IS_LIMITED, greenhouse gas emissions reduction]                 [climate change, IS_UNAVOIDABLE, global warming]                 [climate change, HAS_ADVERSE_IMPACTS, low-likelihood outcomes]                 [climate change, HAS_ADVERSE_IMPACTS, potentially very large adverse impacts]                 [global warming, IS_CAUSING, climate change]                 [global warming, IS_IRREVERSIBLE, climate change]                 [global warming, IS_LIMITED, greenhouse gas emissions
